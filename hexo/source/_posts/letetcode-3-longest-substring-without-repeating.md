## longest substring without repeating
给定一个字符串，找到没有重复的最长字串。
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
**Examples:**
Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.
Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {}
};
```
